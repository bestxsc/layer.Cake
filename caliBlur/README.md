caliBlur is a branch of project layer.Cake. This is a comprehensive plex-themed front end UI for [Calibre-Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web). Thanks for making such a great app! And massive thanks to [@hexeth](https://github.com/hexeth) for joining the project and the immense amount of code he's contributed. All the JS is his work and needless to say this project could not have been completed without him!
